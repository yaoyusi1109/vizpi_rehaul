# VizGroup: An AI-Assisted Event-Driven System for Real-Time Collaborative Programming Learning Analytics

![title](pictures_md/image.png)

## Introduction

Programming instructors often conduct collaborative learning activities, like Peer Instruction, to foster a deeper understanding in students and enhance their engagement with learning. These activities, however, may not always yield productive outcomes due to the diversity of student mental models and their ineffective collaboration. In this work, we introduce VizGroup, an AI-assisted system that enables programming instructors to easily oversee students’ real-time collaborative learning behaviors during large programming courses. VizGroup leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to recommend event specifications for instructors so that they can simultaneously track and receive alerts about key correlation patterns between various collaboration metrics and ongoing coding tasks.

## Project Overview

The Task Management System backend is built using Node.js and Express, providing a robust server-side framework for managing API requests, real-time data processing, and AI integrations. It leverages Azure OpenAI services and Langchain to enhance various functionalities such as task description generation, function name detection, unit test generation, and topic analysis. The backend architecture includes controllers, models, services, and real-time communication handlers to ensure efficient task management and AI-driven insights.

Key features include automated task description refinement, generation of pre-coding quiz questions, real-time chat functionalities, and secure user authentication and authorization.

## Guidelines for Code Refactoring

- Every member involved in refactoring must have a dedicated branch for this purpose: `ec2-yourName`.
- Before starting any development work, always pull from the `ec2` branch and merge into your current branch.
- All refactoring-related code can only be committed to branch `ec2` after thorough testing.
- When you decide to refactor a service, document it in the progress part below for tracking refactoring progress.
- If you encounter a feature that cannot be implemented via the backend API, submit an issue in the backend project, specifying the method name and location.
- If implementing a feature requires calling at least two APIs, submit an issue in the backend project, specifying the method name and location.
- Since it may not be possible to deploy normally until all interfaces have been rewritten, please ensure to commit correct code to branch `ec2`.
- Before using any backend API, test it with Postman to ensure you are aware of all the data it returns.
- We use Axios to send the HTTP requests.
- You can change the parameter list of the functions. But, do not change the name of the functions.
- If you have any other thoughts or suggestions regarding these guidelines, please submit an issue in the backend project.
